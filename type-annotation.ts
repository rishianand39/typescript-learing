// types in TS
// string, number, boolean, array, any, 

// number[], string[], Array<number>
// we can use either number[] or Array<number> syntax, both serves the same purpose

// any, use whenever you don't want a particular value to cause typechecking errors. By writing type any you are convincing TypeScript that a particular line of code is okay.


// Type Annotations on Variables
let myName: string = "Alice";

// In most cases, though, this isnâ€™t needed. Wherever possible, TypeScript tries to automatically infer the types in your code
